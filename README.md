## üéìOverview

QUIZDOM is a web application for all kinds of users. Users can simply log in to be able to create and join quizzes by sharing the quiz code. There might be lots of quiz-generating applications, but the idea of creating a quiz and then taking it on the same platform and evaluating the students in such a way is the key feature of this application.
